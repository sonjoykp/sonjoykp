I'm [Sonjoy Kumar Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonjoyp/), a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html). My research interests include Cybersecurity and Cryptography.

Previously, I worked for five years as a C++ software engineer at [CodeCrafters International Ltd.](https://www.codecraftersintl.com/), where I gained extensive experience in large-scale portfolio management and credit analysis software. I had the opportunity to work on complex projects with a codebase of over 2 million lines. I have expertise in code review, software development, and implementing efficient data structures.

Furthermore, I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/), Dhaka, Bangladesh. In addition to C++ and C, my top skills include software engineering principles and system design.
